# 🏥 Insurance Charges EDA & Feature Engineering

This repository contains an end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** workflow performed on the `insurance.csv` dataset.

The goal is to analyze factors affecting **medical insurance charges**, clean and preprocess the data, and prepare it for future machine learning models.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform **EDA** to understand relationships between features such as age, BMI, smoker status, and region.
- Handle **missing values**, duplicates, and outliers.
- Apply **feature engineering**:
  - Encode categorical variables (sex, smoker, region)
  - Create new features if useful
- Visualize insights using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Prepare a **clean dataset** for downstream ML models.

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- Distribution of insurance charges across age groups  
- Correlation heatmap of numerical features  
- Boxplots for outlier detection  
- Pairplots to analyze feature relationships
