## 📌 Overview  
Real-world datasets are messy — they contain missing values, outliers, duplicate records, and mixed data types.  
This repository shows:  
- How to **clean and preprocess data** efficiently  
- How to **perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visualizations  
- How to **engineer and transform features** to improve machine learning performance  

This is a reusable reference for anyone working on data science and ML projects.
